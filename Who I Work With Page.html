		    <h2>Who I work with</h2>
			<p><strong>I work with Professionals who are feeling anxious and having a difficult time dealing with work expectations or are feeling depressed and disconnected in their personal relationships.
			<br>
			<br>
			I help my clients eliminate the fears that are holding them back from living the life they want.
			<br>
			<br>
			I help them feel in control, confident and energized doing work they love and connected and joyful in their personal relationships with others and with themselves.
			<br>
			<br>
			My clients come to me experiencing these kinds of challenges at work and home...
			<br>
			<br>
			… They are feeling stuck</strong> in their current job and bored with what they are doing day to day. They know that they need to be doing something else that would make them feel invigorated about the work they do. They need more of a challenge - the job they are in has exhausted its excitement. They need to learn more but are lacking the confidence to do so.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>……They need a change in their life</strong> as they are at a crossroads.   They are wanting to explore avenues in their lives to incorporate fun and joy but unsure of where to start or have forgotten what brings joy or ignites their creativity and imagination. They seek clarity to pursue their passion. 
		    <br>
			<br>
			<strong>….. They are experiencing a loss of motivation and feeling depressed.</strong> They want answers for their sadness and want to change their mindset to be in control of their lives again. They crave a shift that creates within themselves a happier disposition.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>…… They are lost and indifferent in their personal relationships.</strong> They want to stop repeating old behaviour that is self-harming and stop the self- sabotage. They seek change in their behaviour with guidance on how to create positive experiences in their lives.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>They find success with me because they are ready to make changes in their life, and are willing to clear the fears and blockages that were disabling them. They know what they need and they have tried on their own, but needed help to get there to be able to stand in their own power.
    		<br>
			<br>
			I work with people who want to be in control again of their lives</strong> and their future direction so they can step into their own unique self with confidence, assurance and decisiveness.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>I work with people who are seeking someone to help guide them</strong> within a safe and caring environment where they feel understood and accepted.
			<br>
			<br>
			<strong>Perhaps fear of opening up and expressing yourself openly has been difficult for you in the past, but now you are ready to open up and not only face your reality but also discover your potential.</strong>
