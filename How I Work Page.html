		<p><strong>My clients come to me feeling anxious and seeking change or guidance in their personal or professional life. My clients experience these kinds of results from working with me…</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>· They have increased confidence to make the changes</strong> in their work that they desire so that they are excited about the work they do. They get clarity in what the changes are and identify how to do it. They are able to see their own gifts and talents, allowing them to make the changes confidently to challenge themselves professionally.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>·They find the clarity they seek to change their life</strong> by listening to their own inner guidance to make the decisions that will bring excitement and fun experiences into their lives. With this shift they find the assurance to follow their gut instinct and to trust your gut instinct that will guide you.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>· They Feel optimistic about their future and motivated about life</strong> - no longer bogged down by sadness. They are willing to uncover the fears or blockages that are limiting them and by gaining a new mindset so they can step into feelings of internal peace and contentment.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>· Feel they can finally let go of old patterns of behaviour</strong> that are sabotaging their personal relationships. They create new positive behaviour that changes their internal self- talk which creates new results, bringing with it genuine satisfaction in their personal life.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>My work helps my clients to open up their mind so it is clear</strong>, so that they can confirm or set new life goals for themselves and take confident steps in making them a reality.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>Working with me will get to the nitty gritty of the problem/s – the core issues and root cause of your blockages so that you can finally let them go.</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>This process is done through “muscle testing” – the key technique in Kinesiology. Through this, I detect and correct whatever imbalance your body presents with, that is related to the stress you are currently facing. This allows you to reach your true potential!</strong></p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>In this process you will be supported</strong> in the journey of healing and I will show you ways to keep you on track.</p>
		<br>
