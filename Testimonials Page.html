			<p>In recent years I was fortunate to meet Sissi while attending a Kinesiology course. Sissi was training to be a PKP Professional Kinesiology Practitioner, while I was updating modules within the PKP System. I am a Kinesiologist with training that stems back 27 years and after meeting Sissi, working beside her and being a student where she was the practitioner, I have no hesitation about her ability, manner and professionalism to be an absolutely reputable Practitioner. </p>

			<p>I came to Serenity Clinic with very little knowledge about Kinesiology but an open mind to try something new. I went through a very bitter and complicated divorce at just 25 years old, and when I got out of the situation, my main goal was to find inner peace and calm and that is what promoted me to go to Serenity Clinic. I cannot accurately describe what Sissi did, but it’s impact on me was extraordinary. It was as if my body was communicating to me what it needs to overcome the internal struggles I was going through and ever since my session, I have felt more control over myself. </p>

	    <p>When I first went to Sissi, I had been struggling for quite some time with feelings of suppression. I had been my husband’s carer for years and slowly over time had slipped into a pattern of giving my power away. He was in a lot of pain on lots of levels, so I abdicated myself to make him feel safe, important and of value etc His anger though, was something I had lots of issues coping with. This was affecting negatively, how I was feeling about myself, and how I behaved in the world. The way Sissi works with Kinesiology, she was able to identify the underlying issues of why I was allowing this to happen. The balance she did released and diffused so much stress from my mind and body, from the first session. I function so much better now and I am generally much happier since releasing that negative pattern. My husband is happier too. I just love the way Sissi works with Kinesiology and I highly recommend her on all levels.</p>

			<p>Sissi was the first person that I trusted to enter into Kinesiology with! I had heard about the practise before through friends, but never came across a kinesiologist that I connected with on a level that I felt I could work with. I instantly felt connected with Sissi, then organically grew to know about her practice, and was straight away finding myself wanting to give kinesiology a go. Sissi’s soft nature, along with her ability to deliver honesty and realism is comforting and that is the reason why I continue to visit Serenity Clinic as much as my body and mind needs, which is something that Sissi also helps me determine! Sissi’s helpful nature is so evident at all times, I even find when I bump into her out of sessions, she always helps lift my spirits, while grounding me and I am grateful for that. The consistency in Sissi’s care and compassion is flawless. I would recommend visiting her clinic – she has helped shape my life in many positive ways, which has in turn helped my daughter, friends and family be able to enjoy a happier and more clear headed and hearted mama/family member/friend. Thank You Serenity Clinic.</p>

			<p>I was reluctant to believe in Kinesiology since it’s hard to believe in things you don’t know, nor understand until you really start paying attention to it. I went to Australia 2 years ago and I took the opportunity to meet up with Sissi, after talking to her about Kinesi and my condition of having panic attacks and some depression and wanting to ease my way to stopping taking anti-depressants. During my first session, I noticed the difference! It was amazing how she guided me through the session and brought out some of the issues that were causing my depression. We spent like an hour or so (I lost track of time) and when my first session ended. I was so relaxed, body and mind, that I had to book my second session right away. My second session was different, since I knew what to already expect. Sissi did a great job again. She’s so sweet and delicate and makes you feel comfortable right from the start. During this session is when she also gave me sprays to use to support myself if I was under any sort of stress. Serenity Clinic is a place to visit, not only when it is your last resource, but also when you want to do some prevention before it’s too late.</p>

		<p>My Kinesiology experience with Sissi has been amazing. She is welcoming and kind and very skilled in her practice. After each session I felt wonderful, much more connected to myself, in tune with my body and my thoughts more clear and focused. Sissi really helped me get rid of my blocks and free up myself so I can work towards my career and enjoy my busy life</p>
