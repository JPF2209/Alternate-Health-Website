		<p><strong>I first came to know about Kinesiology years ago whilst living in the Blue Mountains in NSW.</strong>
		<br>
		My sister had referred me to a wonderful Kinesiologist for my Autistic son, and although initially the visits were for him, I was then invited to come on my own. It was an engaging, personal, confronting experience, hitting the sore spots of my issues at the time. </p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>I was at a cross roads in my life, stepping back into the professional world, dealing with relationship issues and all whilst being a mum and managing life as best as I could.</strong> Life was all very overwhelming and confusing. I knew I needed help, but did not know how to help myself. Kinesiology was totally for meâ€¦ it was like an awakening. Giving me the awarenes I needed for change, for transformation and for healing. It didnâ€™t happen overnight, but slowly I began to change, allowing myself to grow within my own spirit, becoming stronger, more confident, more decisive and more aware of how thoughts and words would manifest itself in my life.</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>I always have had a sense of kinship and deep sense of wanting to make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives but I was sensing an urgency to do more and give more. </strong>
		<br>
		Kinesiology for me was the perfect balance, where I could work with people, have a love for people and be able to bring my communication skills, the science and healing qualities and skills of Kinesiology and marry them together to become a Kinesiology Practitioner.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p><strong>I completed a Diploma in Kinesiology and have been practicing Kinesiology professionally since 2017 in my home- based practice.</strong> I continue to grow in the science of Kinesiology and I also continue to add other healing methods and modalities, skills and tools which I use to enrich the work I share with my clients. I love what I do and that I am entrusted by people to help guide them into change and healing through this wonderful healing modality called Kinesiology ðŸ˜Š</p>
