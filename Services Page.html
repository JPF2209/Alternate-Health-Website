			<p><i>Kinesiology at Serenity Clinic</i></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Based in Bathurst, NSW, Serenity Clinic helps you to find what it is that you really want to do and to believe in yourself, because doing this will bring you confidence, make you feel empowered and bring you joy.</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Each session will look into the areas in your life that you want to change. </strong>Each session will give you new awareness of yourself, your current issues and ways on how to clear the issues by applying the awareness in practical ways in your life.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>You will be able to gain confidence through intentional mind shifts.</strong> Clearing fears or blockages that are standing in the way of you standing strong as your own unique self. This in turn will encourage you to step into a future where you can create more positive and satisfying experiences.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Your body is a bio-computer, and through the Kinesiology process the bio-feedback is accessed helping to get to the nitty gritty of your problem.</strong> Through this process you can face your blockages or your fears head on and clear them.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Doing this will lead you to be free to live a successful life</strong>, one that comes from a sense of achieving your goals, feeling satisfied in the work you do and the way you live your life. Having these in place will leave your feeling fulfilled with our own sense of serenity every day.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong><u>What to expect in a session</u></strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>What will happen in a balance?</strong><i> A Kinesiology session is called a Balance, working with me, you can choose to lie down, sit or stand up whilst I work with you to realign and correct your energy, so that you can feel at your utmost potential!</i></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>As a Kinesiologist I will work through muscle testing, which can tap into the conscious, sub conscious and unconscious states of your mind that takes us to the root of your issues.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Once this is achieved, then clearing these issues is the next step of the balance process, which is done holistically using different techniques</strong></p>
			<p><strong>(the holistic approach incorporates the emotional, mental, physical or spiritual aspects of you).</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Each balance is different, depending on each person’s personal goal for that specific session.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>In a kinesiology balance we will work on a SMART Goal for you. These are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely goals that we determine through exploring what you need help with right now.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>At times you will benefit from a single session, but to get to the nitty gritty of an issue or blockage, you may well receive greater results through a series of balances that are determined by your needs. This will become more clear during our first session.</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Initially the first balance takes 1 ½ hours as a medical history is taken on this first visit. Subsequent balances then take only 1 hour.</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>After the session, you may feel relaxed and lighter in your spirit, feeling less stress.</strong> At times you maybe need to take time to rest after a session, simply due to the many shifts and changes that occurred during the balance. This may happen especially when tapping into deeper issues or difficult memories that need clearing.</p>
			<br>
			<p>After the session, you will really feel the change in your spirit, feeling lighter, focused and clear in your thoughts and generally feel like a burden has lifted off you.</p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Your stress levels will have lowered and you will walk away not only feeling great, but feel positive of what steps to take next in your life and help you feel more confident and assured of who you are and what you want!</strong></p>
			<br>
			<p><strong>Depending on the issue explored during the balance, I may give you some tools and techniques used in the session to take home that will help reinforce your new awareness and mind shifts that will lead you to healing, transformation or growth.</strong></p>
			<p>These take home tools may include meditation exercises, visualizations, massaging acupressure points, exercise, activities, or by supporting your body through diet or supplements.</p>
			<p><strong>All the components within the balance is specifically designed to cater for your needs, to help you and challenge you to move forward in your life with confidence and clarity.</strong></p>
			<p><i>If what I have said so far is speaking to you and you can resonate with it, <strong> I invite you to go to the '<a href="Contact Page.html">contact</a>' page.</strong> where we can chat about what it is that you would like help with and what are the possible outcomes you want for yourself or just to book in a session.</i></p>
